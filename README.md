# spring-shell-tutorial

In this repository we will give a quick introduction to the Spring Shell project, which can be found at [https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-shell](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-shell).

According to the documentation [https://spring.io/projects/spring-shell](https://spring.io/projects/spring-shell) we have that 

> Users of the Spring Shell project can easily build a full featured shell (aka command line) application by depending on the Spring Shell jars and adding their own commands (which come as methods on spring beans). Creating a command line application can be useful e.g. to interact with your projectâ€™s REST API, or to work with local file content.

That is, the Spring Shell project allows you to build a command line application, leveraging many of its features including tab completion, colorization and more.

## Usage

Build the JAR file using

```shell
./gradlew build
```

and then run the JAR using

```shell
java -jar build/libs/spring-shell-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

As soon as the program boots up, use the `help` command to navigate your way through the cli.
